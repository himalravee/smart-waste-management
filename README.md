# ♻️ Smart Waste Management System (Image Processing Based)

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Waste Management System** is an **image-processing-based project** that classifies waste into categories such as **plastic, glass, paper, and metal**.  
By automating waste classification, this project supports **sustainable recycling and efficient waste management**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖼️ **Image Preprocessing** – resizing, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding.  
- 🔍 **Contour Detection** – isolates the waste item by detecting its outline.  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Classification** – identifies the type of waste using a trained CNN model.  
- 📊 **Visualization** – displays processed images and predicted labels.
